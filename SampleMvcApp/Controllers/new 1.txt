Controller is a Class that implements an interface IController. This controller has methods called Actions. Every URL mapping is done to a specific action. Every Action will return a Result what is called as ActionResult. An ActionResult is an abstract class that has many implementor classes that are specific to the kind of the result they wish to give: ViewResult, PartialViewResult, JsonResult, ContentResult to name a few..
The job of the Action is to get the data(Model) and inject the data into a View which is found thro ViewEngine and return the View or any of it that is required for UR App requests.
An Action can return any kind of data that can be represented as String.
